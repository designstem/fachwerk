## Ocean cleanup initiative

-

A lot of people are aware of their footprint and are taking action to make the world a better place to live.

At age 16 (2011), Boyan Slat came across more plastic than fish when diving in Greece. He decided to devote a high school project to a deeper investigation into ocean plastic pollution and why it is considered impossible to clean up.

He later came up with the idea to build a passive system, using the circulating ocean currents to his advantage, which he presented at a TEDx talk in Delft in 2012.

<caption>🛠️ Hands-on activity</caption>

## Chalk challenge

1. Take a piece of chalk and weigh it.

2. Place it vertically and put a weight on it.

3. Use a knife, rasp or file to take some material off the piece of chalk. **Note:** the length of the chalk must stay the same.

4. Try to leave just as much chalk as you need to maintain a strong construction. Be careful that is does not break.

5. If you think you have reached the optimum… Let’s put the weight back on.

6. Did it break? If it does not try to scrape off some more chalk and test it again.

## Why do we mimic nature?

There is a **duality** between nature and engineering, when it comes to lightweight constructions.

* **Nature survives with a minimal use of energy**. As engineers we can learn from nature to reduce material, energy and thus costs.

* **Nature has the ability to adapt** to its changing surroundings during its life time. For example, the skin of a <var>sea cucumber</var> is extremely flexible, but becomes very rigid in the blink of an eye when it is threatened. As engineers, we can learn from nature’s strategy to make more resilient structures.

## Efficiency of construction

</section>

-

<section style="padding-top: 0;">

Making constructions is not only a matter of choosing the right <var>material</var>.

It also involves the combining a <var>material</var>, <var>form</var> and <var>production process</var> to make construction **light** and **strong**.

</section>

-

<section style="padding-top: 0;">

The efficiency of construction also depends on <var>type&nbsp;of&nbsp;load</var> the construction has to carry such as <var class="gray">bending, pressure, tension, shear, torsion, vibration</var> etc.

When designing an object an engineer investigates all its possible loads.

## Growth of trees and bones

During their lifetime both these natural structures make **optimal use of material** to cope with stresses and loads.

-

<img src="./images/tree2.jpg"  />

-

#### The ability of trees to adapt

Trees **only add material where it is needed** by producing thicker tree rings at heavier loaded spots e.g. when a tree is constantly exposed to wind on one side, it grows thicker at the other side. 

-

<img src="./images/bone2.jpg"  />

-

#### Bones ability to adapt

Bones also produce extra material where needed. They are also able to **eliminate material** in less loaded spots.

## Palms and shells

-

#### Palm trees

Palm trees have evolved leaves which can respond to different environmental conditions.  During favorable weather, the leaves spread out to absorb more sunlight during photosynthesis. During storms, the leaves fold up. The folding makes the more leaves compact,  stronger and more resistant to damage. 

-

<f-image src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Close_Up_look_of_Leaves.jpg"  />

-

#### Sea shells

Shells have evolved to carry external loads efficiently.
The folds help the thin-layered shells to resist predators and damage by wave action.

Honeycombs are hexagonal-shaped cells. They are used as core infill for the the composite sandwiches used in aerospace structures or in kitchen doors.

Honeycombs are are lightweight and when it pressed into a mold, it adapts to its form. 

Beeboard you’ll find in your everyday kitchen cabinet door.

> #### You will need
* Two sheets of A3 paper, if you use thicker paper you probably may a ruler and a cutter to etch the lines first
* pencil
* double-sided tape
* cutter

## 2D structure optimization

Let's see how nature comes up with structures like hexagons and soap bubbles. 

For simplification let's tackle two dimensions first and use a set of circles arranged in 2D plane.

**Let's extend the circle radiuses so they extend and collide with other circles.**

-

<f-animation set="r" from="0" to="1.2" duration="10500" />

<f-scene responsive>
	<defs>
  	<clipPath id="clip">
      <polygon
        :points="polarpoints(6, 1).map(({ x, y }) => x + ',' + y).join(' ')"
      />
     </clipPath>
  </defs>
  <f-group scale="1.53">
  <f-hex-pattern scale="0.5" rows="4" v-slot="{ row }">
  <f-circle
  	fill="#aaa"
		clip-path="url(#clip)"
    :r="get('r')"
    stroke
  />
  <f-circle stroke fill="black" r="0.05" />
  </f-hex-pattern>
  <f-hex-pattern scale="0.5" rows="4">
  <f-hexagon
    stroke="white"
  />
  </f-hex-pattern>
  </f-group>
</f-scene>

<p />

When extending **regular** set of circles, we end up with a <var>hexagonal</var> structure.

<img style="filter: grayscale(100%)" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Voronoi_growth_euclidean.gif" />

When extending **irregular** set of circles, we end up with a dried clay like structure. It is called <var>Voronoi diagram</var> or its dual <var>Delaunay triangulation</var>.

## 3D structure optimization

Let's explore how a regular or irregular set of spheres behave when combined together.

The physicist Lord Kelvin proposed that a 14-faced polyhedron or <var>tetrakaidecahedron</var> is similar to the structures the nature creates. The structure was later improved by physicists Weaire and Phelan.

## Back to the bone

When you cut a through a thigh bone you’ll see a foam structure that is optimally formed by the forces it has to carry. So, bone is strong and light. 

Like foam, bone could eliminate material by adapting to the changes in the environment, but of course not at the same speed soap bubbles do!

<caption><big>Optimization by deformation</big></caption>

## Deformation

The <var>deformation</var> (and even <var>failure</var>) of existing materials and structures under load can be very instructive for the designing and building of new ones.

First of all, deformation teaches us about the fundamental of loads and stresses.

Prof. Dr. Claus Mattheck uses rubber plates and sheets of aluminum foil to help you visualize loads and stresses in structures.

## Deformation as a shape optimization

Last but not least: deformation can be seen as a kind of <var>shape optimization</var>.

Let’s go back to the rubber plates and sheets of  aluminum foil of Prof. Dr. Mattheck.

The way these (isotropic) **materials** bend, fold, stretch and twist can be seen as an effective adaptation to loads.

<caption>Optimization by deformation</caption>

## Shapes under stress

Holes and notches in a piece of rubber under stress deform in such a way that local concentrations of stresses are reduced and loads are distributed evenly.

The shapes that "occur" in this way are to be found all over in the natural and manmade world!

## Deformation<br>as a clue

The way aluminum foil deforms (and eventually tears) under tension tells us a lot about lines of <var class="gray">compression</var> and <var class="gray">tension</var>.

Here too, deformation offers us clues about the optimal shape given a particular load.

## Stressed shape as a template

The shape of components under stress can be used as a <var>template</var> for a new design that’s better suited for a particular load:

1. Apply force and observe the  deformation.

2. Use the deformation as the basis of a manufactured form.

## Design<br>to disappear

In the past 20 years designers, artists and makers are looking more and more for **sustainable alternatives**. Ecology and design became an integrated practice.

As an answer to the throw-away society they choose a **circular approach**. Their ideal is that disposable products are fully degradable or are the raw material for something new. Making degradable objects could be done with biobased material.

-

## Experiment<br>to design

With this circular approach designers, architects, makers, scientists and craftsmen all participate in the **experimentation with materials** and are forced to work together interdisciplinary.

Their inventiveness and creativity made possible as a result of this opportunity of **working with hands, new techniques** and by **working interdisciplinary**.

## From disgust to desire

By 2050 when the world population is predicted to   exceed nine billion, feces, hair and dust are among the few natural resources which will actually increase.

Feces are a low value natural material and could be used to make functional products.

## Shape and Countershape

Remember Christien Meindertsma’s FLAX Chair? 

She made optimal use of the material using the full sheet of cloth to make a chair.

The principle behind this is using <var>shape</var> and <var>countershape</var>. 

The principle of shape and countershape is used across all art and design disciplines, including **graphic design**, **art**, **product design** etc. 

Let’s look at some examples.

## Final assignment

-

You have practised different methods and techniques to minimize waste when designing a new product. 

Design a usable object using one of the techniques (shape and countershape folding, cut and fold). 

Do this by following the steps on the next slide. 

-

#### Key steps

1. Choose your material and look at the dimensions of the material. 

2. Make at least three 2D sketches. Keep in mind that you cannot have waste material. For example if you use a sheet of hardboard take the standard size to work with. (You can also make your design in such a way that you can make several out of one sheet.)

3. Choose one of your 2D sketches, or a combination of them, and make a 3D sketch model of it.

4. Evaluate your model: add or adjust where needed.  

5. Make your final object.
